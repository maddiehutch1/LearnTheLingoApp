# LearnTheLingoApp

THE GOOD
* learned a lot while building this app and feeling a little more confident than before
* getting the data from the model, through the viewModel, and into the views was my biggest accomplishment
* I finished 3 / 4 persistent progress components (lesson, quiz, and flashcards) -- the app recalls what the toggles were left at
* I designed the app to be simple and appealing to the user
* in other words, the front end turned out great!

THE NOT-SO-GOOD
* the backend functionality... hmm, not so much :/
* realized how much I did not know
* debugging the app was difficult with my limited understanding
* the quiz... was not able to successfully set up the scoring or the sound to work
